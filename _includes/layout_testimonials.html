          <p class="testimonial-text">"I love how passionate Hana is about creating an exciting learning environment
            in which everyone can get results, while having fun. It's a great feeling to achieve
            success through something you've learned and created from scratch - especially as a
            Mum when so much of your time is spent focused on others. I can highly recommend these
            courses to anyone (Mum or not), looking to learn a practical new skill in an enjoyable and
            supportive way."</p>

          <p class="testimonial-text">"Hana was nice enough to offer to mentor me in the past few months.
            She's been a most helpful mentor; flexible in terms of the timing of our sessions and very
            supportive and knowledgeable regarding the topics I had questions about. I can highly recommend
            her!"</p>

          a better future for themselves and their children through learning to code. It’s so important
          not to have to choose between work and bringing up baby, and being able to code is such an
