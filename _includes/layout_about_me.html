         <h2>Hey, I'm Hana!</h2>
          <p>I learnt to code when my first child was born, and you can too. Since I
            was fifteen, I have loved combining teaching with my passions. Learning
            to code made it possible for me to combine family and work life, creating
            great digital products while collaborating with many great people.</p>
          <p>I'm looking forward to introducing you to the world of coding. Let's
            write your first lines of code together.</p>
