          <p>I learnt to code when my first child was born, and you can too. Since I
            was fifteen, I have loved combining teaching with my passions. Learning
            to code made it possible for me to combine family and work life, creating
            great digital products while collaborating with many great people.</p>
          <p>I'm looking forward to to introducing you to the world coding. Let's
            write your first lines of code together.</p>

            in which everyone can get results, while having fun. It's a great feeling to achieve
            success through something you've learned and created from scratch - especially as a
            Mum when so much of your time is spent focused on others. I can highly recommend these
