          <p>We believe in learning by doing. With
            this approach we’ll have you not only understanding coding languages and

          <h3>Build Live Projects</h3>
          <p>From lesson one you'll be working on your own projects. This means you
            can immediately apply what you’ve learnt to your own website. Super useful.</p>

          <p>I learnt to code when my first child was born, and you can too. Since I
            was fifteen, I have loved combining teaching with my passions. Learning
            to code made it possible for me to combine family and work life, creating
            great digital products while collaborating with many great people.</p>
          <p>I'm looking forward to to introducing you to the world coding. Let's
            write your first lines of code together.</p>
